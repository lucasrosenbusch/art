library(art)
art(10,10)

```
If you want to create art like this you can simply use the new package **art**.  
You can install the package like that:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github('lucasrosenbusch/art')

```{r, eval = FALSE}
art(x_dim, y_dim)
```
You can also check the help page for the art:
